# ✅ Setup Complete - Here's What Changed

Your project is now configured for automatic deployment via Vercel's GitHub integration. **No GitHub Actions needed!**

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do NOW

### 1. Add `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` to Vercel

Your build is currently failing. To fix it:

1. Get deploy key: https://dashboard.convex.dev → `fleet-chickadee-379` → Settings → Deploy Keys
2. Add to Vercel: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Name: `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`
   - Value: The deploy key
   - Environments: All

### 2. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure automatic deployment"
git push origin main
```

**That's it!** Vercel will now successfully deploy both Convex and your frontend.

📖 **Detailed steps:** [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Push to GitHub
    ↓
Vercel detects change (via GitHub integration)
    ↓
Runs: npx convex deploy --cmd 'vite build'
    ↓
    ├─→ Deploys Convex (generates convex/_generated/api)
    └─→ Builds frontend (uses generated files)
    ↓
Deploys to production ✅
```

**No GitHub Actions. No complex setup. Just push and deploy.**

## 📝 What Changed in Your Project

### Modified Files

1. **`vercel.json`**
   - Build command now deploys Convex before building frontend
   - Fixes "Could not resolve convex/_generated/api" error

2. **`package.json`**
   - `npm run build` - Deploys Convex + builds (used by Vercel)
   - `npm run build:local` - Just builds frontend (for local use)

3. **`README.md`**
   - Updated with simple deployment instructions

### New Files

- **`AUTO_DEPLOY_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide
- **`QUICK_START.md`** - Quick fix for current build failure
- **`SETUP_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

### Removed Files

- ~~`.github/workflows/`~~ - No longer needed
- ~~`GITHUB_CI_CD_SETUP.md`~~ - Replaced with simpler guide
- ~~All GitHub Actions related files~~ - Unnecessary complexity

## 💡 Daily Workflow

Development:
```bash
npm run dev              # Local development
```

Deployment:
```bash
git push origin main     # Auto-deploys everything ✨
```

That's it! No manual deployment commands needed.

## 🐛 Current Issue

Your Vercel build is failing with:
```
Could not resolve "../../convex/_generated/api"
```

**Fix:** Add `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` to Vercel (see step 1 above)

Once added, Vercel will deploy Convex during the build, generating the missing files.

---

## ✅ After Setup

Once `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` is added:
- ✅ Every push to `main` deploys automatically
- ✅ Pull requests get preview deployments
- ✅ No manual deployment needed
- ✅ Convex and Vercel stay in sync

---

## 🎉 Benefits

**Before:**
- Complex GitHub Actions workflow
- Multiple secrets to manage
- Separate Convex and Vercel deployments
- More moving parts

**After:**
- Vercel GitHub integration only
- One secret: `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`
- Single deployment process
- Simple and reliable

## Questions?

- **Where are deployment logs?** Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
- **How do I test locally?** `npm run dev` (no changes)
- **Manual deployment?** `./redeploy.sh` still works
- **Disable auto-deploy?** Vercel Settings → Git → Disconnect
