# TeachingTools Interactive Classroom App
  
This is a project built with [Chef](https://chef.convex.dev) using [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.
 You can find docs about Chef with useful information like how to deploy to production [here](https://docs.convex.dev/chef).
  
This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`fleet-chickadee-379`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/fleet-chickadee-379).
  
## Project structure
  
The frontend code is in the `app` directory and is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
  
The backend code is in the `convex` directory.
  
`npm run dev` will start the frontend and backend servers.

## App authentication

Chef apps use [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Anonymous auth for easy sign in. You may wish to change this before deploying your app.

## Developing and deploying your app

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the frontend (Vite) and backend (Convex) in development mode.

### Deployment

#### Automatic Deployment (Recommended) ðŸš€

**Setup once:**
1. Add `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` to your Vercel project settings
2. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
3. Done! âœ…

Every push to `main` automatically deploys both Convex and Vercel.

ðŸ“– **Setup guide:** [AUTO_DEPLOY_SETUP.md](./AUTO_DEPLOY_SETUP.md)

#### Manual Deployment

First-time deployment:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Quick redeployment:
```bash
./redeploy.sh
```

Or deploy individually:
```bash
npm run deploy:backend   # Convex only
npm run deploy:frontend  # Vercel only
```

## HTTP API

User-defined http routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts` to allow us to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.
