# Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your Interactive Classroom App to production using the automated deployment scripts.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure you have:

- [x] Node.js and npm installed
- [x] Convex account (sign up at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev))
- [x] Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- [x] Git repository (optional, but recommended)

## üöÄ Initial Deployment

### Step 1: Make sure you're logged in

```bash
# Log in to Vercel (if not already)
vercel login

# Log in to Convex (if not already)
npx convex dev
# Then stop it (Ctrl+C) - this initializes your Convex project
```

### Step 2: Run the deployment script

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check for required tools
2. ‚úÖ Deploy your Convex backend to production
3. ‚úÖ Generate secure JWT keys for authentication
4. ‚úÖ Ask for your Vercel project name
5. ‚úÖ Build and deploy your frontend to Vercel
6. ‚úÖ Configure all environment variables automatically
7. ‚úÖ Redeploy with correct configuration

### Step 3: Test your deployment

Visit the Vercel URL provided at the end of the deployment to test your app!

## üîÑ Quick Redeployment

After the initial deployment, use the quick redeploy script for updates:

```bash
./redeploy.sh
```

Choose what to redeploy:
- `1` - Backend only (Convex)
- `2` - Frontend only (Vercel)
- `3` - Both

## üîß Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually or need more control:

### Deploy Convex Backend

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

### Deploy Vercel Frontend

```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Set Environment Variables

#### Convex (via dashboard)
1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select your production deployment
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` (generate with `node generateKeys.mjs`)
   - `JWKS` (from the same script)
   - `SITE_URL` (your Vercel URL)

#### Vercel (via CLI)
```bash
vercel env add VITE_CONVEX_URL production
# Enter your Convex production URL when prompted
```

## üåç Environment Variables Reference

### Convex Production Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` | RSA private key for JWT signing | `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ...` |
| `JWKS` | JSON Web Key Set for JWT verification | `{"keys":[{...}]}` |
| `SITE_URL` | Your production frontend URL | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |

### Vercel Production Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_CONVEX_URL` | Your Convex production deployment URL | `https://happy-animal-123.convex.cloud` |

## üìù Deployment Checklist

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] Can access the app at your Vercel URL
- [ ] Can sign up / sign in with email
- [ ] Can create a session
- [ ] Can add elements to a session
- [ ] Participants can join with session code
- [ ] Results are visible
- [ ] All features work as expected

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Authentication errors

**Error:** "pkcs8 must be PKCS#8 formatted string"

**Solution:** Make sure `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` in Convex doesn't have quotes around it. It should start with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`.

### Frontend can't connect to backend

**Error:** Connection errors or "Convex not defined"

**Solution:** 
1. Check that `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is set in Vercel
2. Make sure it points to your production Convex URL (ends with `.convex.cloud`)
3. Redeploy Vercel after setting the variable

### Vercel build fails

**Solution:**
1. Check build logs: `vercel logs`
2. Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Try building locally: `npm run build`

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's in `.gitignore` for a reason
2. **Use different JWT keys for dev and production** - The script generates new keys automatically
3. **Rotate keys periodically** - Regenerate JWT keys every few months
4. **Use custom domains** - Set up a custom domain in Vercel for better branding and security
